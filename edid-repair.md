# Repair wrong physical dimensions in screen edit file
the steps of adding the new edid to initramfs and rebuilding the initramfs are distribution specific! in my case gentoo

## find the port the display is connected to
```
$ for p in /sys/class/drm/*/status; do con=${p%/status}; echo -n "${con#*/card?-}: "; cat $p; done

DP-1: disconnected
DP-2: connected
DP-3: disconnected
HDMI-A-1: disconnected

```

## get edid file
for me it was DP-2
```
$ cat /sys/class/drm/card0-DP-2/edid > broken.bin
```

## change to correct values
I simply used https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxedid/ (download tgz, ./configure, make then run wxedid) to edit  the bin file.
corrected the physical dimensions from 60cm x 34 cm to 94cm x 53cm and saved the new file to /usr/lib/firmware/edid/LG43UN700-B.bin (create directory if needed) 
LG43UN700-B is the model number of my display 

screensize needs to be change in several places, in my case the BDD Entry needed it cm and also every DTD Entry needed the size in mm.

## add kernel command line option
using dracut i added the following to my kernel command line

/etc/dracut.conf
```
kernel_cmdline+=" drm.edid_firmware=DP-2:edid/LG43UN700-B.bin "
```
take care to pick the right port! for me it is DP-2

## add to initramfs
the LG43UN700-B.bin has to be added to initramfs, for dracut I created

/etc/dracut.conf.d/20-lg43un700edid.conf 
```
# Corrected EDID File reports real physical dimensions
install_items+=" /usr/lib/firmware/edid/LG43UN700-B.bin "
```

## rebuild uki
to recreate the initramfs for the current kernel (in my case gentoo uki)
```
$ emerge =sys-kernel/gentoo-kernel-6.6.47 --config
```

reboot and my 42" display is no longer reported as 27" DPI values will match better.
