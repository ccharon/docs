# Turbo PC XT Clone, Christmas 2024 :)
Collecting all the information about my build in one place for future reference. 

I want to build a PC system comparable to a PC XT, using an 8088 CPU, or as in this case a NEC V20 which has some speed improvements 
and also is able to not only execute 8086 but also 80186 machine code, yay! Which hopefully helps to get speedier IDE access 
and a working parallel port zip drive using iomega drivers.

As I don't want to fight dying 40 year old hardware and have some convenience I chose a Monotech NUXT 2.0 mainboard which
already includes a lot of the features needed. For example usage of ps/2 style keyboard + mouse that get translated to a
xt keyboard and a serial mouse. also a VGA card and a XT-IDE is integrated.

Things I want to do? generally explore the machine and its (in) abilities :P . Play games and try some programming in assembler and C.

## Hardware
### NUXT 2.0

### 8-bit ISA Sound Blaster 1.5 clone with C/MS
As Soundcard I chose a 8bit Soundblaster 1.5 Clone. Designed by [David's electronics](https://electronics.dose.se) in Sweden.
I bought the card on [tindie.com](https://www.tindie.com/products/kdehl/8-bit-isa-sound-blaster-15-clone-with-cms/)

#### Features of the card
- Adlib (OPL2)
- Sound Blaster sampled audio 
- MIDI, through the usage of a Joystick-to-MIDI adapter 
- CMS (SAA1099) Game Blaster chips installed

### 8-bit ISA Ethernet Controller
As Network card i chose and 8 bit ISA RTL8019 that is NE2000 compatible. Designed by [Weird Electronics](https://www.tindie.com/stores/weird/#store-section-about) in USA.
I also bought this card on [tindie.com](https://www.tindie.com/products/weird/isa-8-bit-ethernet-controller/)

#### Features of the card

### 8-bit ISA Lo-tech EMS 2MB
To expand the memory of the PC XT I chose a Lo-Tech 2MB EMS card. This card I purchased at [texelec.com](https://texelec.com/product/lo-tech-ems-2-mb)

#### Features of the card
- 2MB memory accessible as EMS 

#### Website and drivers
